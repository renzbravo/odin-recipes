    <h3>Description</h3>
    <strong>Naan</strong> is a traditional flatbread made in South and Central Asian countries, while pita bread is eaten in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Pita is made with a very simple dough, using just flour, salt, yeast, and olive oil, while naan dough has ingredients like yogurt and egg that make it a little more tender and fluffy.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp instant / rapid rise yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm tap water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp whisked egg</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>30g / 2 tbsp ghee or unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><em>Optional Finishes</em></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>30 g / 2 tbsp ghee or unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 small garlic clove</li>
        <li>Nigella seeds</li>
        <li>Coriander/cilantro chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix yeast with warm water and sugar in a small bowl. Cover with cling wrap, leave for 10 minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>Whisk milk and egg together.</li>
        <li>Sift flour and salt into separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the flour, add yeast mixture, and butter and egg mixture. Mix together with a spatula. Once the flour is mostly incorporated, switch to your hands and bring it together into a ball. No kneading is required.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with cling-wrap, then leave in a warm place for 1 – 1.5 hrs until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Cut into 6 equal pieces, then shape into balls into spheres with a smooth surface by stretching the surface and tucking it under</li>
        <li>Place balls on a lightly-floured tray or plate. Sprinkle lightly with flour, cover loosely with a lightweight tea towel. Put in a warm place to rise for 15 minutes until it increases in size by about 50%.</li>
        <li>Place a round on a lightly-floured work surface, flatten with your hand. Roll out into 3 – 4mm / 0.12 – 0.16" thick rounds (about 16cm / 6.5" wide).</li>
        <li>Rub a cast iron skillet with a very light coat of oil using 1/2 tsp oil on a paper towl (unless already well seasoned). Set over high heat until you see wisps of smoke.</li>
        <li>Place a naan dough in the skillet and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until the underside is deep golden / slightly charred – the surface should get bubbly. Flip then cook the other side for 1 minute until the bubbles become deep golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove, set aside, and repeat with remaining naan, taking care to regulate the heat of the skillet so it doesn't get too hot.</li>
        <li>Brush freshly cooked naan with melted butter or ghee (or garlic butter, Note 5). Sprinkle with nigella seeds and coriander. Serve hot!</li>
    </ol>
